# C3W4 Getting and Cleaning data project

# Output (avg_data)
The script run_analysis.R will produce a data frame called "avg_data" that will contain the tidy data
Each row of "avg_data" contains averaged data from each subject and each activity from features that contain:
1. Mean value (mean)
2. Standard deviation (std)

# Variables (columns in avg_data)
 [1] "activity_ID"
 [2] "activity" (related to activity_ID: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING and LAYING)
